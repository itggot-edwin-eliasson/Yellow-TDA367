1. Introduction

The readme for the inventory and renter handling application Yellow. This readme aims
to make you understand how to run and use the program and inform you briefly of how
the application is structured.

To run the application you need to navigate to the Main class located in the
src/main/java/Controller package. Run the class in your IDE to start the application.

2. User guide

The application is built around groups and inventories. When you start the application
you will be asked to sign up or sign in. Start with creating an account if you don't
already have one.

When logged in all groups your part of are listed in a panel to the left. Click on a
group to manage that specific group. When in a group you will see a list of all
inventories that group has. Enter an inventory to manage that inventory.

Inside an inventory is where the fun happens. Here you can add items to the inventory.
You can see when a specific item is available or rented in the calender that shows when
you click an item. You can also make an order on an item by pressing the "Add to order"
button. You can add items from different inventories to the same order.

After adding your items to an order you need to navigate back to the group page where
you finnish your order. Here you press the order button. Enter the information required
to complete the order and press the "Complete Order" button. If all the items are
available you will now find your order in the list of your current orders. It will
remain there until the order is returned and you press the "Order is returned" button.
After that the order will still remain in the old orders list.
